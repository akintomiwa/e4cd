# An Agent Based Model (ABM) for modelling Electric vehicle driver behaviour


This particular ABM model considers EVs which undertake urban or 'interurban trips' of a set length. The state of each EV is moderated by a state machine and cycles between states such as idle, travelling, in queue and charging. 
During multi-day runs of the model, the EVs' odometers are reset at the end of every day. 

This is an early version of the project and remains under development.
